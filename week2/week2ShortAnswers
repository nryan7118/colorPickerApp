-There is regular and compact. What it’s referring to is the space of the screen.
-landscape mode: compact height / regular width
-portrait mode: regular height / compact width

b) What is Continuous Learning, and why is it important in mobile development?

-Continuous Learning is the idea that you continue learning new ideas and new techniques throughout your career to stay relevant and to keep your mind active longer. 
Continuous learning involves focusing on a subject and setting up a learning path to learn new knowledge while also building and keeping what you already know fresh. 

c) How can you find out what modifiers a View has?

You can look in the library or you can put a period “.” And a list will populate

d) What is a breakpoint?

A breakpoint is like a stop sign. You place a breakpoint on a line and it enables you to view the state of the variables in that given line of code. Used in debugging code when you receive an unexpected result. 

e) How can you access environment values in your App?

You use @Enviroment
@Enviroment(\.keypath) var propertName

f) How can you determine, in code, if the App is in Dark or Light Mode?

You can use the environment property 
@Enviroment(\.colorScheme) var colorScheme

g) Why are magic numbers an issue, and how should you avoid them?

Magic numbers are numbers that are hard-coded into your code. They should be avoided because it’s hard to tell where they come from. Turning them into constants avoids that confusion.  

h) How can you view your App in Light and Dark Modes simultaneously?

You can manually add another view by copying the current instance of the preview and you can change and modify the view by choosing another device, orientation, and dark/regular view. 

i) Below is an image of the Canvas from Xcode. The Canvas is in selectable mode. Can you explain why the red background does not cover the entire button area?
￼

Because a view only takes up as much as space as needed. With this error you would want to ensure to implement the frame before the background.

j) Modifier padding(10) adds padding to the view's top, bottom, left, and right sides. How could a padding of 10 be added to only the left and right sides of the view? The answer for this question should be a short section of code.

.padding(.horizontal)

k) Provide two reasons why you would want to extract views.

One of the main reasons to extract code is to keep the code organized, modular, and reusable. 
This makes it easier to make changes in the app. You only need to go to one view to make the changes

l) How can you determine, in code, if the device is in Portrait or Landscape mode?

@Environment(\.verticalSizeClass) var verticalSizeClass
@Environment(\.horizontalSizeClass) var horizantalSizeClass

If verticalSizeClass == .regular &&
    horizontalSizeClass == .compact {
Code
}

m) What is a literal value?

A literal value is any number without a decimal point. 

o) What are the safe areas?

It’s the top of the screen with the battery indicator. Not somewhere where you would want to put any writing. But if you want to ignore the safe area you can use “.ignoreSafeArea()”

p) This line of code was in the lesson on animation. Can you state in English what the line means?
.frame(width: wideShapes ? 200 : 100)
If the width is wideShaps is true use 200 otherwise use 100

q) Describe the two transitions you were introduced to in this week’s lesson.

There was ease in, ease out. That’s where the view is slowly moved into the screen and moved out slowly.
There was also the scale transition, where the view shrinks down and scales up. 

r) In Bullseye, the Game struct is what type of object?

It is a model

s) What are SFSymbols?

Those are shapes that are commonly used in app development. Like the redo symbol, the three little lines for menu. You can access these images with the SFSymbols app and in code by using systemName

t) What is the difference between “step into” and “step over " in the debugger?”

When using step into you are stepping into the method letting it run, if you step over, your skipping that line of code

u) Name some items you would place in the Asset Catalog (Assets.)

Background colors, stroke colors. You would put colors that are used in the app in the asset catalog. 

v) How do you change the Display Name of your app?

You select the main folder, the very top, and you go to the general tab —> identify —> display name
