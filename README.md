**Part 1 - Short-answer questions.

You will put the answers to these questions in a README file in your homework repo once you create it in Part 2, so for now just keep the answers in a text file.

Answering the questions is mandatory for a passing grade, but the accuracy of your answers won’t be graded. Your mentor will give you feedback if you answer them incorrectly.

Try answering the questions without looking up the answers in the content. Trying to recall the answers from memory and writing in your own words is a really effective technique to improve your memory. If you get stuck, review the content and write the answer in your own words. The only guaranteed way to get these wrong is to not answer them!

a) What does the command ‘git status’ output?

git status outputs the current status of your repo. If there are no changes to merge it will tell you its clear. If there changes it can tell weather or not they are in the staging area. 


b) In SwiftUI, anything that gets drawn on the screen is a view.


c) print(“Hello world”) is an example of a Function call.
viewModel.getData() is an example of a Method call.


d) Name some Views you have seen so far in SwiftUI.
	•	Text
	•	slider
	•	button
	•	stacks


e) How do you create a new local repository using git? (Feel free to answer with how you use git, i.e. terminal or another app)

On the Github app you can click in the upper right hand corner of the app, where it says your current repository and select the drop down "add" button and select "create new repository". 

f) How do you preview your app in multiple orientations?

When in the canvas portion of Xcode you can select the icon for the canvas device settings and toggle orientation or within the stimulator you can click the rotate icon on the top right of the bar


g) An app is made up of instances of classes and structs that contain data  and methods.

h) Name two components of a SwiftUI Button.
	•	Data 
	⁃	What it looks like
	•	Functionality
	⁃	What the button does

i) In git, what is the difference between a local repository and a remote repository?

k) What is a branch in git, and how do you create one? (Feel free to answer with how you use git, i.e. terminal or another app)

A branch typically deals with one task, they are used to make changes or add more features to the app more manageable. Once you are in the correct repository, you will click the branch down arrow and click "new branch"

l) What are some common mistakes that can lead to errors while programming?

Typos, syntax errors, capitalization issues, using incorrect object names. 

m) VStack, HStack, and ZStack are Stack views used for layout.


n) How do you list the branches on your local repository? (Feel free to answer with how you use git, i.e. terminal or another app)

Using the Github app you can click on the History tab.

o) What happens when @State variable changes in SwiftUI?

The rest of the code refreshes to keep the @State variable and the view stay in sync with each other. 

p) What is the Single Responsibility Principle?

Each class in the app only does one job

q) What will the print statement below produce?
var name = “Ozma”
print(“Hello, \(name)!”)
Hello, Ozma!

r) What commands can you use in git to download data from a remote repository? What commands can you use in git to send data to a remote repository? (Feel free to answer with how you use git, i.e. terminal or another app)
To download data from a remote repository you could use your Github desktop app and use the "Fetch origin" option and to send data, you would commit your changes that you make on a file from the Github desktop app

s) Why is a programming To-Do list important, and what is a minimum viable product?

A to do list is everything you have to do to build the app. Usually has a must do and a hopeful list. The minimum viable product is the must do portion of the list.

t) What is a simple way of describing Binding in SwiftUI?

It connects a piece of code to an object. Like a button or slider.

u) What command do you use in git to move changes from one branch to another? (Feel free to answer with how you use git, i.e. terminal or another app)
You can compare the branches and then perform a merge commit within the desktop app. 

v) What is the type of the variable defined below?
var a = 87
A is an int

w) What is the difference between var and let?
A var creates a variable which can be changed throughout the app and let creates a constant which cannot be changed.**
