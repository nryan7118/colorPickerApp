a) 0…5 and 0..<5 are two types of ____________. How are they different?

- 0…5 is an exclusive range — including 5.   
- 0..<5 is a closed range and does not include 5

b) Describe type inference in Swift and give an example.
- Type inference is when Swift figures out the type by the initial value without declaring the type 
 - var dogName = “Kobe” 

c) List three advantages of Playgrounds.
- you can run code and see instant results w/o building or running the app
- allows you to test functions and methods w/o the need of an actual project
- Only one file for a playground instead of multiple for Xcode project 

d) When does the execution of a while loop end?
- It ends with the condition is checked and it comes out false

e) True or False: Tuples in Swift can contain values of different data types.
- True

f) List three data types you have used in Swift.
- String
- Int
- Bool 

g) To execute alternative code when the condition of an if statement is not met, you can use what clause?
Else clause 
If 2 > num {
print( “2 is more than \(num)”)
Else {
print(“2 is less than \(num)
} 

h) What is the third element of the array nums defined below?  
let nums = [5, 0, 44, 20, 1].
-  20 is nums[3] 

i) An ____________ is a unit of code that resolves to a single value.
-expression

j) Define two ways to unwrap optionals in Swift.
- Force unwrapping — var favSuperHero = String?
    - Var unwrappedFavSuperHero = favSuperHero!
- Optional Binding — 
    - If let marvelHero = marvelHero {
    - }else {}

k) True or False: The condition in an if statement must be true or false.
- True

l) Arrays in Swift are ____________ indexed.
- zero 

m) An unordered collection of unique values of the same type is a _____________.
- Set 

*Above and Beyond*

Area: square1 - 16 square2 - 25
Area: rectangle1 - 20 rectangle2 - 20

The first line of code — print("Area: square1 - \(square1.area()) square2 - \(square2.area())") which comes to: 
Area: square1 - 16 square2 - 25  is calculated as such 
Area: square1 - part of the print statement
16 is calculate by the function area() which returns an Int value(16) it multiples the side by itself. The side is provided in the declaration for square1 which created an instance of the Square structure, it provided the value 4 for the side length, which in turn the area function used to do the calculation - side * side which was 4 * 4. Which gives us the result: 16. 
- The rest of the statement: square2 - is part of the print statement and 25 resulted from the  declaration: var square2 = square1, square2.side = 5
-  And print("Area: square1 - \(square1.area()) square2 - \(square2.area())”), which is also the same call used for the first part of the line as well

The second line that was returned — Area: rectangle1 - 20 rectangle2 - 20 came from the rectangle class and the area function. It used the call Area: rectangle1 - 20 rectangle2 - 20 and the declarations var rectangle1 = Rectangle(length: 4, width: 4)
var rectangle2 = rectangle1
rectangle2.length = 5
